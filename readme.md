### My Learning Journey

I'm currently trying to learn how to code. I'm doing a couple of courses on Coursera while at the same time reading a few books (my goal is to complete the OSSU roadmap):

**Courses**
- *Python for Everybody Specialization* on Coursera. Great course and teacher!
- *The Unix Workbench* on Coursera. Good overview of Linux CLI and intro to git.

**Books**
- *A Practical Guide to Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming*, Sobell, Mark.

### Going forward

I'm hoping to stay committed this time, but it feels like I'm in a better place and understanding core concepts a bit more. Last time around I started with Harvard's CS50 which, while fun for the first 4-5 weeks quickly turned very difficult.
